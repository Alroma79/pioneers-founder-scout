- ✅ Added structured logging with context (parameters, errors)
- ✅ Graceful handling when HarvestAPI fails
- ✅ Better error messages and debugging information

### 2. **Enhanced Scoring System**
- ✅ Adjusted thresholds: **A=80+**, **B=60+**, **C=<60** for meaningful tiers
- ✅ More selective Tier A candidates (top performers only)
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for scoring logic

### 3. **Improved Streamlit UI**
- ✅ **Tier A highlighting** with visual distinction
- ✅ **Summary statistics** showing counts and averages
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy and user experience
- ✅ Professional styling with custom CSS

### 4. **Comprehensive Testing**
- ✅ Unit tests for `normalize`, `scoring`, and `utils` modules
- ✅ Edge case coverage (invalid data, empty responses)
- ✅ System validation script for end-to-end testing
- ✅ All tests passing with proper assertions

### 5. **Production-Ready Features**
- ✅ **CSV backup mechanism** prevents data loss
- ✅ **LinkedIn URL validation** for better data quality
- ✅ **Robust error handling** throughout the pipeline
- ✅ **Input sanitization** and validation

### 6. **Complete Documentation**
- ✅ **Comprehensive README** with setup guide, examples, architecture
- ✅ **API documentation** with curl examples
- ✅ **Known limitations** clearly documented
- ✅ **Contributing guidelines** and development setup
